	<h2>Objectives</h2>
	<p>The aim of the Socialist Party (India) is to establish a socialist society. The Party will carry on activities conducive to propagation  of socialist policies and programs. The members will engage in constructive activities like the cooperative management of both the means of production and distribution in the economy. The Party will promote decentralization of economic activities by developing small scale industries based on manually controlled machines as far as possible. The Party will launch peaceful struggles against anti-people activities of the State. The Party will also participate in parliamentary processes like fighting elections held by the Election Commission of India within five years of the formation of the Party to stabilize the gains of the  movement. The Party also believes that socialism cannot be achieved unless a socialist mindset is developed among the general population. This can be achieved by encouraging people to move away from the excessive consumerism and individualism of modern times and promoting independence of thought and action. Socialist ideas need to be propogated among people through cultural means such as literate, theatre and art. Women and backward castes should be empowered so that they can effectively influence decision making process. The Party will not indulge in violent activities nor would it incite or encourage it. The Party is firmly committed to peaceful means.</p>
