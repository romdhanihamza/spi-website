	<h2>Why India Needs Socialism</h2>
	
	<p>The character of politics in India has undergone a major change during the last two decades. It has distanced itself from the needs and aspirations of the common masses and has, instead, focused its energies in implementing the dictates of the world economic bodies that nourish neo-liberalism and United States-controlled neo-imperialist establishments. This anti-constitutional and servile character of Indian politics has found its nourishment in communalism, casteism, parochialism, money-power, muscle-power and family lineage at the cost of constitutional values like socialism, democracy and secularism.</p>

	<p>Neo-liberal economic policies which facilitate the capitalist-consumerist model of development are basically anti-poor and anti-development. The propagators of these policies tirelessly chant the mantra of faster growth rate. However, growth rate cannot be an indicator of true development. Even as the rate of growth of the GDP gathers momentum or faces a slow down, social and economic crises continue to multiply. The truth is that problems which bring misery to the general population - inflation, deprivation, malnutrition, diseases, unemployment, external dependence and volatility - are deepening with this apparent growth, even as the wealth of a select few reaches new heights. Large profits are made through speculative trading at stock exchanges and commodity futures markets. Also, the relentless consumption of natural resources creates a clear diversion from the requirements of the common people.</p>

	<p>In such challenging circumstances, the achievements of certain Latin American countries in their stride towards socialism through the democratic mode and the wave of democracy sweeping over certain Arab countries, present a glimmer of hope. It has been amply illustrated by such developments that the strengthening of the democratic socialism alone offers opportunities towards a better future for the world. The Socialist Party believes that in order to achieve this goal, a new socialist movement needs to be created and mobilised with the support of like-minded, existing socialist parties.</p>
	
	<p>The SPI advocates a decentralised, self-reliant economic system inspired by a Gandhian-socialist model of development. </p>
