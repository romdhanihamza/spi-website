<p>Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail was recently allowed in India in the face of mass protests, by a leadership lacking in a proper understanding of its implications for the millions of small business owners, traders and self-employed people working in the unorganised sector who currently drive the Indian retail industry. The move is likely to affect the livelihood of millions, lead to large-scale job-loss, increase urban migration and fundamentally change the way a large portion of our country’s population works and lives, yet the decision to implement it did not involve any kind of public participation or pre-legislative consultation. If FDI is truly in the long-term interest of all Indians, there was no reason to not give them a say in the decision. The move is indicative of the increasingly elitist and anti-poor nature of Indian economic policy, which focuses on the superficial idea of growth, and has little to do with the ground realities of a majority of India’s people.
