<h2>BJP rally to be held by trampling over rights of SC community.</h2>

<p>On 19 October, 2013, a BJP rally is proposed at a ground opposite Buddha Park in Indira Nagar near Kalyanpur in Kanpur. The administration has declared this as an empty ground whereas the fact is that in 1972 the Social Welfare department allotted this land to 127 families of Denotified castes Bhantu and Habuda so that they could earn their livelihood by carrying out agriculture on this land. Salina Devi of Habuda community in a petition to Chairperson, Scheduled Caste Commission, has stated that the British declared them a criminal tribe around 1872 and put them in settlement.</p>

<p>She was born here. Her grandfather Govinda was given land here. In 1972 her family got one acre land here in their name. After her father’s death the land was transferred in her mother Narayan Dei’s name. Today she lives on this piece of land along with her mother and they cultivate this land. Her plot number is 47 and they also have receipts of revenue payment made to Social Welfare department.</p>

<p>On 5 October when BJP applied to get this land for their rally, the electricity department, social welfare department, police and tehsildar all gave their permission on the same day. The District Social Welfare officer states that this land is lying vacant and if it is given for a rally for a few hours he has no objection. The Social Welfare officer has given the land on which members of Bhantu and Habuda communities have been resettled to a third party without even asking them. After this the local BJP leaders stopped the tractor which was cultivating Salina Devi’s land.</p>

<p>On 9 October, 2013, BJP leaders Premlata Katiyar, Raghunandan Bhadauria, Laxmikant Vajpayee, Satyadev Pachauri, Neeraj Chaturvedi, Rakesh Sonkar, Shyam Bihari Mishra, Bhole Singh and others entered her plot forcibly and the accompanying labourers started clearing the land after which Bhoomi Puja was also performed. Her protests fell of deaf ears including those of police which was present throughout and she was repeatedly threatened by BJP leaders.</p>

<p>The DM Sameer Verma and ADM Avinash Singh have also decided not to pay heed to her objections.</p>

<p>We seriously object to the ignoring of interests of denotified castes and demand from the administration to cancel the permission given to BJP’s rally on this ground.</p>
