<section class="page"><p>In theory, India has a universal public healthcare system, however, in practice, due to the lack of proper infrastructure and facilities and an inadequate workforce, along with widespread corruption and inefficiency, only a small portion of Indiaâ€™s population is able to benefit from this system. The rest are either forced to rely on the private sector, or on incompetent quacks. In recent times, thanks to our shift towards neoliberal economic policy, government expenditure on healthcare as a fraction of its total budget has gone down dramatically and national health policy has become more focused on providing support and encouragement to the private health sector. India spends 0.9% of its GDP on healthcare, the figure is higher even for countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. We believe that access to free and quality healthcare is a human right. There is an urgent need to formulate stronger policies and legislation which will lead to the universalisation of access to basic healthcare and social insurance.</p></section>
