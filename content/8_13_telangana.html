<h2>We welcome Telangana, but with a word of caution.</h2>

<p>The Socialist Party welcomes the formation of Telngana state and congratulates its people. The party believes that there has been a geographical, cultural, political, economic and administrative justification behind the demand for separate Telangana state. It has been a demand based on peoplesâ€™ genuine will. The people of Telangana region made a long struggle for around 60 years to achieve the goal. Several people lost their lives in police firings and self immolations during the agitation. Had the central and the state leadership taken timely decision on the issue, these lives would have been saved. Socialist Party appeals to the supporters of undivided Andhra Pradesh to accept the decision in  good spirit and to help the new state in its development. Leaders from coastal Andhra and Raylaseema regions should exercise restrain in the best interest of people who have been living together for years.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party had passed a resolution in favour of Telangana state at its formation convention held at Hyderabad in May 2011. Since then the national and Andhra Pradesh state leaders of the party have played an important role in the creation of Telangana state. Prof. Keshav Rao Jadhav, national vice president, and Nurul Ameen, general secretary, continuously participated in the agitation at state level. Justice Rajindar Sachar, senior leader of the party, and Bhai Vaidya, national president, expressed solidarity with the supporters of Telangana and raised their demand at various forums.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party would nevertheless, like to caution the prospective leadership and political parties of the resource-rich Telangana that the valuable natural resources should not be open to loot by corporate houses. Rather the resources should be used for the upliftment of the hard working masses. The political leadership should ensure that all citizens get education, health, employment and good governance in the new state.</p>

General Secretary and Spokesperson</p>
