<h2>FDI in Retail</h2>
<p>Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail was recently allowed in India in the face of mass protests, by a leadership lacking in a proper understanding of its implications for the millions of small business owners, traders and self-employed people working in the unorganised sector who currently drive the Indian retail industry. The move is likely to affect the livelihood of millions, lead to large-scale job-loss, increase urban migration and fundamentally change the way a large portion of our country’s population works and lives, yet the decision to implement it did not involve any kind of public participation or pre-legislative consultation. If FDI is truly in the long-term interest of all Indians, there was no reason to not give them a say in the decision. The move is indicative of the increasingly elitist and anti-poor nature of Indian economic policy, which focuses on the superficial idea of growth, and has little to do with the ground realities of a majority of India’s people.

<p>India should oppose the WTO which pushes FDI into Banks, Insurance, water, electricity, defence matters. Efforts should be made to steer Indian economy from being dependent upon, and being geared to benefit, corporate capitalism. India must not rush into signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and other bi- and multi-lateral trade agreements that would jeopardize access to essential and affordable medicines, seeds and adversely impact other sectors of small and medium scale enterprises.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party believes in sustainability at local level as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi's Gram Swarajya and Dr. Lohia’s ‘Four Pillar’ model. Opening markets internationally doe not provide equal level playing field to domestic players. We have seen how big industries (whether domestic or multinational) are given undue benefits and promotions to help protect their markets and domestic players are dealt with a heavy hand making it all the more difficult for them to survive.
