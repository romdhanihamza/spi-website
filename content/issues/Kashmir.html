	<h2>Jammu Kashmir, Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura</h2>
<p>The terrain in these border states being so difficult, greater priority should be accorded to providing rail and road facilities there. As insurgency is fast receding in all these areas, the military may be withdrawn or at least AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) be lifted with immediate effect. Issues in these states should be resolved peacefully with due regard to the rights and aspirations of the people. The Socialist Party expresses concern, particularly over the terrorist attacks and assaults aimed at those who have been participating in the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir. The discrimination which often occurs against people of these states living in other parts of India for education, employment, and self-employment etc. should come to end.<p>
