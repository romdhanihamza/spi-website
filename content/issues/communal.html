	<h2>Communal Harmony</h2>
<p>Effective communal violence law must be enacted soon and implemented ardently. Innocent Muslim youths should not be rounded up in combing operations nor should they be made to linger in jails for indefinite time. Persons responsible for terrorist acts must be brought to book with no loss of time. But ordinary people must not be unjustly harassed in the process.
The Socialist Party has made a demand that the mortal remains of Bahadur Shah Zafar should be brought back to India from Rangoon (presently Yangon), Myanmar, by the government of India. The party has submitted a memorandum to this effect to the President of India. Zafar was the leader of our First War of Independence against the colonial powers and a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity. The Socialist Party, at its national convention, launches an all India movement in favour of the demand. The people of India should collectively support this demand of the Socialist Party while enjoying the fruits of freedom.</p>
