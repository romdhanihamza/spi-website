	<h2>Military Forces</h2>
<p>The Socialist party considers the jawans of the Army, Navy and Air Force as the backbone of our defence system. These jawans, who render sterling service to safeguard the borders, should be treated well by their superior officers. Trained jawans should not be deployed as orderlies to serve their officers. This legacy of old days of colonialism should be stopped immediately. Their families back home must also be looked after with care and honour.<p>

<p>India has earned a bad name as the largest single big purchaser of military hardware in the world market. Lakhs of crores of rupees go down the drain as commission. This must be stopped. No more purchases should be made from Western producers. Let our scientists, engineers and technicians, who have put satellites in the sky, develop and produce heavy armaments and vehicles for our armed forces. India is not a military state and should not indulge in the armsâ€™ race which hampers the welfare schemes. There should be no stockpile of nuclear arms. No nuclear plant should be commissioned e. g. Kudankulam, Jaitapur, Gorakhpur etc. or built in future.</p>
