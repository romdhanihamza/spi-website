	<h2>The Environment</h2>

<p>The Western model of development has posed a serious threat to the environment the world over. Since this model of development sustains itself upon indiscriminate exploitation of the natural resources, the call of its propagators for ‘sustainable development’ or ‘development with a human face’ is hollow.

The committee will examine the threat posed to the eco-system by the capitalist model of development and suggest alternatives based on the thoughts of thinkers who advocate harmony between nature and people and differentiate between need and greed.</p>
