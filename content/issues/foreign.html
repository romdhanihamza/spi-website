	<h2>Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>Maintenance of world peace and cooperation and Protection of Human Rights should be the guiding principles of our foreign policy. Bonds of friendship with the neighbours and other countries of East Asia and Africa should be strengthened while taking due care and caution about the security concerns of our country. The foreign policy of the country should be free of the neo-imperialist pressures/interests. For example, the treaty on gas pipe line between India and Iran was dropped due to the US pressure. Sincere diplomatic deliberations should prevail upon direct military action because war brings havoc to humanity. India should pursue the policy of peaceful co-existence with the neighbouring countries. But it should not be done at the cost of land and people of the country. A fitting reply must be given to a neighbour if there is a genuine threat. However, jingoistic rhetoric serves no purpose. On the contrary, such verbosity exposes hollowness of their real commitment.</p>

<p>In the light of the recent Chinese intrusion into 19kms of Indian Territory, the Socialist Party will initiate a movement to stop all imports of Chinese goods into India so that China does not repeat the practice again. The party does not support direct military action in such incidents and believe that all such disputes should be resolved through bilateral negotiations. But the party does support and demand policies which would protect our local markets, small and middle scale industries and local craft artisans across the country. Such a resolve will strengthen our economic power. Banning imports from China and promoting domestically produced products will give double boost to our economy and put more pressure on China to respect international borders including Indiaâ€™s. 
The Socialist Party firmly demands that the Indian land occupied by China in the war of 1962 must be vacated and calls upon the Indian government to review its position with regard to Tibet, particularly in the light of persistent Chinese intrusion throughout the Indo-Tibet border. The Party expresses its deep concern over the unabated violence in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The same imperialist forces, that are responsible for the havoc in these countries, are playing with emotions of the Muslims by circulating objectionable materials in various forms. These forces, in their lust for profit, are not ready to allow peace and harmony a chance to prevail in the world.</p>
