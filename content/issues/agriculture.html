	<h2>Agriculture</h2>
	<p>India’s agriculture policy since the time of the Green Revolution has been focused on promoting industrial agriculture. This has meant a large-scale shift from traditional agricultural methods to chemical-intensive, mechanised farming leading to an exponential rise in production costs. Trade liberalisation has opened up the seed, fertilizer and pesticide markets to big agri-business corporations which with their non-renewable, input-intensive seeds, and expensive, environmentally destructive chemicals have rapidly changed the nature of farming. Chemical fertilizers are heavily subsidised by the government, and over time chemically-treated soils become lifeless and require larger and larger quantities of inputs to produce the same yield, this makes a transition back to organic, self-reliant agriculture difficult. These developments have been accompanied by falling prices of farm commodities, which has meant that farmers often spend more on growing their crop than they earn from it, pushing them deep into debt. In the last 15 years close to 250,000 farmers have committed suicide many more have been forced to give up farming and migrate to cities. Today about 60% of India’s population is still directly or indirectly dependent on farming, yet the manufacturing and service sectors take much higher priority in the government’s financial planning. The emphasis of agricultural policy is on increasing yield, yet today India produces enough food to feed our whole population. What is required is more equitable distribution. There is a dire need for the government to realise the importance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices which allow farmers to be self-reliant. Farming needs to be recognised as a profession of national importance, and farmers given their due by providing them material and financial support such as fair Minimum Support Prices and minimum wages for farm labour, training in sustainable agricultural practices and promoting sustainable and equitable food production.</p>
