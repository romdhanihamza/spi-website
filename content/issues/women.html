	<h2>Women's Rights</h2>
<p>State should ensure an end to female foeticide, honour killings, bride-burning for dowry and sexual harassment. Violence towards the female citizens at home, in the workplace or on the streets must stop. For this men need to radically change their mindset and habits. Popular pressure should be built up to prevent the objectification of women in the media. Not just cosmetic gestures like introducing an exclusive bank for women, but the channelling of adequate flow of banking services towards women, from all the branches of the banks, should be promoted and monitored.</p>
