	<h2>Basic Education</h2>
	<p>The state of basic education in India is dismal. 25% of India’s population is illiterate, and only 15% of Indian children reach high school. Drop-out rates are high, with one out of every three children enrolled dropping out before class five, and one in two dropping out before reaching class eight. The vast majority of those in school are part of India’s public education system, but due to insufficient funding and a lack of proper facilities, the quality of education in government schools very often leaves a lot to be desired. The Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 which makes education a fundamental right is a welcome step towards ensuring universal access, however the Act also has many shortcomings, especially when it comes to closing the gap between the standard of education and educational facilities accessible to the rich and those provided for the underprivileged. Loopholes in the Act will allow many private schools to get away with not implementing the 25% quota for poor children. Also, it puts little emphasis on improving teaching standards, the first step to which would be to provide teachers with better salaries and make all public school teachers permanent government employees. Children often face abuse, discrimination and mistreatment in school, and are put under tremendous pressure to perform. Rote-learning is encouraged and there is little scope for self-expression and creativity. There is a need to rethink our system of education and devise more meaningful teaching and evaluation methodologies. All of this can only be achieved if our government reformulates public policy to make education reform a top priority.</p>

	<h2>Higher Education</h2>
	<p>The higher education system in India is largely publicly funded. However, even within the public sector there is a lot of variation in educational standards and facilities. While elite institutions such as the IITs and IIMs are flush with funds and have developed world-class infrastructure, most Indian Universities are struggling to retain good faculty and maintain standards due to insufficient funding. This indicates a bias towards promoting vocational programmes such as engineering and management over the natural sciences, the humanities and arts. In addition, many elite institutions are highly exclusive, due to the medium of education, which is always English, and the nature of their entrance examinations. The few from among the underprivileged who get through find themselves in a harsh environment, and are often discriminated against. The recent decision to expand reservations across all higher educational institutions is a step towards making them more inclusive. However, there is also a need to improve the admission procedure and the curriculum so that students from rural and non-English speaking backgrounds are not at a disadvantage. Also, the fundamental sciences, humanities and arts need to be supported as they are essential for promoting critical thinking and fueling social and political change in society. This is only possible by strengthening our University system and making it accessible to all citizens.</p>
