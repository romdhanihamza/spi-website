	<h2>Panchayati Raj</h2>
	<p>The objective of India’s Panchayati Raj system is to ensure democratic, local self-governance, and to have at the foundation of India’s political system a decentralised form of government where each village is responsible for its own affairs. The proper functioning of this system is key to establishing true grass-roots democracy and allowing the least privileged among us to have a voice in the political system. Unfortunately, large-scale corruption prevents the panchayat system from serving this purpose. In addition, instead of working to bring more transparency and greater accountability in the system, in recent times there have been moves to weaken the sovereignty of the Gram Sabha by allowing private organisations such as companies and NGOs to step in to perform functions which should ideally be carried out with the mandate of the Gram Sabha. The Socialist Party (India) believes in Gandhiji’s vision of Gram Swaraj and is working to strengthen the Panchayati Raj system in India.</p></section>
