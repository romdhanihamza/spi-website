	<h2>The Right to Water</h2>
		<p>The world contains sufficient freshwater to meet the personal and domestic needs of all people on the planet, and water used for these purposes accounts for just 10% of all water used in human activities. Yet, today a large number of the world’s people do not have access to a basic supply of water from a clean source, many more have to walk long distances or put themselves in physical danger to be able to collect clean water for their families. It is obvious that lack of access to water stems from inequity and unequal power relationships, more than the actual lack of fresh water on the planet. Recently, the United Nations passed a resolution declaring the Right to Water as a fundamental human right, and India is one of its signatories. The resolution, "affirms that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human dignity." In spite of this, all over the world, water is increasingly being commodified and exploited for profit. More and more of the world’s water is falling into private hands, to be treated as a product with a consumer-base. At the fore-front of this assault on the right to water are the world’s big soft drink companies, primarily Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, both of which specialise in extracting water in huge volumes from public water bodies, adding large quantities of sugar and caffeine to it and packaging it into small bottles to be sold to those who can pay for it. The Socialist Party believes that everyone deserves free and equal access to water, and that communities should control and manage their water resources collectively.
