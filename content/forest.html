<section class="page"><p>Forests are vanishing rapidly all over India. In our greed for wood and other resources, and to make way for mines, industries and cities we are cutting them down indiscriminately and with little regard for the consequences. In this process we are destroying not only our environment and the habitats of a diverse array of wildlife but also threatening the way of life of millions of people belonging to forest dependent communities. These communities have lived in and off forests for thousands of years, they are known for their reverence for nature and the sustainability of their practices. There is a lot mainstream society can learn from them, and it is likely that they hold the key to helping us move away from our environmentally destructive, unsustainable lifestyles and begin to live in more harmony with nature. Yet they are often deprived of their rights to their homes and lands, and denied access to forest resources in the name of conservation. Ironically, the state Forest Departments which implement these conservation laws are often themselves responsible for large-scale deforestation. The Forest Rights Act, 2006 is a recent piece of progressive legislation which for the first time gives such communities the right to protect and manage their forests. However, implementation of the Act leaves a lot to be desired, and the rights of forest dwelling communities continue to be neglected. To ensure that Indiaâ€™s forests are conserved and forest dwelling communities allowed to retain their traditional way of life, the Forest Rights Act must implemented in letter and spirit in all parts of the country.</p>
