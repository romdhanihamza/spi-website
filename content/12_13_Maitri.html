<h2>Socialist Party opposes MAITRI project foundation stone ceremony.</h2>

<p>Socialist Party (India) has strongly opposed the inauguration and proposed foundation stone laying ceremony by UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of MAITRI project on 13 December 2013. Socialist Party (India) workers will join the farmers in showing black flags to the Chief Minister on 13th December.</p>

<p>The Phase-I of this MAITRI project will begin on the land of farmers who have given their land which means that in future this project will expand with more Phases acquiring land from other farmers too. Progressive thinking is that agriculture land should not be acquired unless it is very necessary. This MAITRI project is not a productive project and does not have any social value. There could have been more socially useful and productive projects instead of this 'idol' building. It is also important to recognize that Gautam Buddha was against idol worship.</p>

<p>Maitreya Project International plans to install a 500 ft Buddha statue in Kushinagar, place where Buddha breathed his last and achieved Mahaparinirvana, in eastern U.P. Pilgrims visit this place to pay homage to a reclining statue of Buddha. The founders of the project envision the new statue to inspire the qualities of loving-kindness and compassion among visitors. However, contrary to the stated objective the project has become a threat to the lives of 2009 farmer families of this region who are facing an impending displacement due to the project. The affected farmers have constituted ‘Krishi Bachao Sangharsh Samiti’ (Save Agriculture Struggle Committee) and have organized themselves and demonstrated consistently against the project. They have also fasted to protest against the project earlier under the leadership of Govardhan Gond.</p>
