<h2>History</h2>

<p>The Socialist Party (India) has its roots in the Congress Socialist Party (CSP), which was founded in 1934, and was a socialist caucus within the Indian National Congress. Socialists such as Jayprakash Narayan, Ram Manohar Lohia, S.M. Joshi, N.G. Goray, Acharya Narendra Dev, Yousuf Meherally, Achyut Patwardhan, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay were the ideological leaders of the party, which was founded on the principles of decentralised socialism and secularism. After independence in the year 1948, the CSP broke away from the Congress to form the Socialist Party of India (SPI). The SPIâ€™s agenda included the achievement of economic equality and an end to economic exploitation through public ownership of large industries, strong trade and farmer unions, land reforms and the removal of the great disparities between forward and backward castes. However, with time, the ideology and aims of the party were gradually diluted, leaving India devoid of any national party with a strong commitment to socialist ideals. In the year 2011 several socialist groups and individuals came together to form the Socialist Party (India) which intends to carry forward the legacy of the Socialist Party formed in 1948. The party was formed through a resolution passed by Mr. Pannalal Surana at the foundation conference on May 28, 2011, under the chairmanship of Prof. Keshav Rao Jadhav. The resolution was supported by Dr. Samanthnath Ghosh, Justice Rajinder Sachar, noted journalist Kuldip Nayyar and veteran socialist Bhai Vaidya, among many others.</p>
